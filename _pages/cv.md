I am creative, motivated, detail oriented, productive, and love what I do. I am a full stack developer and designer with experience in print and media production. I have an academic background in visual design and I prefer to focus on UX design. My varied experience with software, programming, project management, and design give me a firm understanding of the varied aspects of web publishing and application development. I understand 'pulling my own weight', time management, professional standards, and current trends in application development. I have experience with server configuration, various APIs, database management, and workflow cycles. I write clean semantic code and I excel in simplifying web applications and the publishing processes.

<h5>2005 - Current &nbsp;|&nbsp; Chief Whatever Needs Doing</h5>
I develop, design, and consult on internet technologies, applications, branding, and publishing. I primarily work under retainer to handle an assortment of mostly IT related responsibilities for small to medium sized clients who don't necessarily need full time IT or development staff. I take on a limited number of clients so that I may service them well. Occasionally, I take on freelance development work from other agencies and dabble in entrepreneurial projects. I'm particularly fond of working for non-profits and arts related businesses.
