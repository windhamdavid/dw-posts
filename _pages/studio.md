This page is here so that I have a place to feature recent projects and showcase some of my artwork. I mostly work with web and application development with a focus on UX design, but I also do a good deal of graphic, print, and multimedia design. I graduated with a degree in studio art from the College of Charleston and I have been working professionally for ten years. I like the word <strong><i>studio</i></strong> because it originates from the Latin word <strong><i>studere</i></strong> which means to study. On my off hours, I like to turn off the computers to draw and paint.
