Daniel Island is a planned residential and commercial area situated between the Cooper and Wando Rivers located in the city of Charleston, South Carolina and is the home to Bishop England High School, which relocated from downtown when the island was developed. The island was purchased from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation. The island is also home to several Charleston venues such as the Family Circle Magazine Stadium, home for the Family Circle Cup and Blackbaud Stadium, home of the city's professional soccer team, the Charleston Battery. Many new housing developments and shopping centers have appeared in recent years, and many more are currently under construction or being planned.
