the <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/program/courses/bydept.php?q=newmedia">The School of New Media offerings this spring semester?</a> and I've figured out that <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/bergman/">Lowell Bergman</a>, a professor there and producer of Frontline (also played by Al Pacino in "The Insider<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0140352/"></a>") is fairly cool and as reported Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe) supposedly lives here even though <a href="http://www.jeffreywigand.com/insider/">his website<a href="http://www.jeffreywigand.com/insider/"> </a> has another address, maybe by way of <a href="http://www.motleyrice.com/">attorney Ron Motley</a> who's down the road a couple miles on occasion and would insist that everyone in <a href="http://www.louisatpawleys.com/">Louis'</a> put out their cigarettes when he arrived back in 98'.  But the movie is good and Motley's passion for the case makes sense <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/interviews/motley.html">if you read this article</a> that gives a little background on his youth in N. Charleston.  I think I'll quit smoking this week... and by the time I see <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/"> Frontline tommorow</a>, I start cleaning up the amex.
