After reading some more info on <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1997/11/28/feat/arts.1.html">Rauschenberg</a> , I ran into this site <a href="http://vernissage.tv/blog/about/">Vernissage.tv</a>. I've noticed the proliferation of sites like this  that use content distributed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)"> RSS feeds</a>.  I found about 2000 listed, about 100 in the US, many are TV station, univeristy, or special interest affiliated and not all of them have continuous content.  And then there are the clearinghouse sites that just link to all of the content like <a href="http://www.jumptv.com/index.html?&language=english"> Jumptv.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.neeptv.com/"> NeepTV.com</a>. The best distribution through outlets like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itunes">Itunes </a>, so let's go ahead and get a framework up for managing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodcast">videocast</a> and audiocast from contributors on two domains that can pull content in now via rss. I like <a href="http://www.twit.tv/">TWiT.TV</a>, you should pick up thier feed. OS X Leopard will intergrate this heavily with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row">Front Row</a> and I'm sure Vista will have something along the same line.
