I am pretty obsessed with lists. Not in an obsessive kinda way, but in a really practical sorta use case scenario. Projects inevitably come down to lists. Every week I work on a shared grocery list with my wife. I make lists of music. I make lists of house chores. The list goes on ... literally.  That's the motivation me keeping a page of the list to end all lists.

What makes this list awesome you ask ...for those of you not stuck behind a terminal for work, let me try to quickly explain. Git is a version control system and in simple terms it's a way to see revisions. Folks like Sindre Sorhus have been using Github in other ways than building software. One such way is making lists for other developers. What makes them awesome is that anyone can review, edit, comment and submit to a list. This sorta open forum makes them very accurate lists. I couldn't possibly count the number of times that I've landed on someone else's list while investigating another topic. And likewise I find myself asking my wife things like what was the name of that movie we saw that had x in it or what was that place we went? Just yesterday I found myself looking for something I've used several times. So I've followed the lead of those other list makers and I'm going to keep a list of lists for myself to reference and I'm going to keep in version control so that it's easy for me to make edits and anyone else to suggest or comment on. I kinda doubt that one day I'll look back on these and think what a waste of time.  Let me know if you have any suggestions. The page will be right here:
