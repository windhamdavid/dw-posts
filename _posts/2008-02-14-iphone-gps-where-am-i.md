what a nice feature in google maps... which speaking of.. Google anounced an update to <a href="http://code.google.com/android/migrating/m3-to-m5/m5-api-changes.html">Android</a>.. fit with a <a href="http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html">media player</a> and a <a href="http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html">geocoding api</a>... mobile computing is going to be <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/11/Android-comes-to-life-in-Barcelona_1.html">big stuff</a> if you campare the number of laptop owners worldwide vs the number of cell phone users...so after tinkering around a bit.. i found a way to ssh into the phone using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/348793/jailbreak-the-iphone-113-firmware-for-third-party-apps">jailbreak</a>.. (<a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2008/01/26/warning-current-iphone-113-jailbreak-may-prevent-official-third-party-apps/">note</a>...the method may prevent installation of official third-party applications that will be created by the forthcoming iPhone SDK (software development kit) from Apple)...and now i want to install the knowitall tool of the century since this is the information age after all... wikipedia at my fingertips all the time.
