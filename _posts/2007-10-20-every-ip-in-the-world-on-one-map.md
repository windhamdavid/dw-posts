click the image to check it out....and i'm doing a strange social networking experiment with every site i could come up with... Yesterday...I took one of my email addresses and signed up for every social network out there and created free blogs with sites like realtor.com and active rain and then linked them all back here... no.. it's not some elaborate link baiting scheme... it's just a test to see what is actually up with social networks.. I noticed that charleston sc has 25,588 people registered.. that's pretty strong.. I drove my ranking up on active rain with links and associates for the fun of it.. all in all most of them are somewhat useless unless your own real social network participates.  I think that my best advice to most people who want to market themselves is to take up a hobby and attend some public events.. nothing works like the real thing and for the most part no one takes anything very seriously online and most of them want to do it anonymously so they can be fun but lack any real substance.  If anyone can send me an email with everyone of my social networking pages.. I will build them a free website...good luck.  these videos were my inspiration for my experiment...
