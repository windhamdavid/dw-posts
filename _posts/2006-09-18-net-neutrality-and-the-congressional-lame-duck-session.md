Net neutrality refers to telecommunications companies lobbying to favor certain content providers and applications.  Think about it.. a company like vonage wants to use the bellsouth dsl connection you are paying for to compete against the bellsouth's telephone service... so the telecommunication companies want to protect themselves... as do the media outlets want to protect themselves from the Ipod, HD radio and IPTV.  So they are spending a ton of money lobbying the issue before congress and it looks like the consumer will be the only casualty.

And those idiots are going to draw political party lines on the issue.
It's just like this <a href="http://www.lasarletter.com/2006/docs/CCAugust312006.pdf">letter</a> written here on behalf of Clear Channel Radio by 24 members of congress.
