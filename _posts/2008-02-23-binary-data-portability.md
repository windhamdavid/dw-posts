i'm doing this logo for a <a href="http://chrissaad.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/dataportability-logo-competition/">contest</a> because i believe in the cause and there's a free iphone to boot.. (i'm always on ginny's and i just installed a decent plugin for mobile editing of this site).. seems that <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> recently sent a Cease and Desist claiming that the <a href="http://www.dataportability.org/">DataPortability</a> logo was too similar to their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(Linux_distribution)">Fedora</a> Logo.
... while i was working on it kris sends me this.

it's what happens when your working with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/">illustrator</a> too long... and actually the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary">binary code</a> got me to thinking of some great ideas for the logo and i got a cool link to this <a href="http://www.paulschou.com/tools/xlate/">encoder</a> from <a href="http://www.paulschou.com/">paul schou</a>

i was researching design firms yesterday thinking about the logo and noticed that now..they're selling rental space on 2008 web trend map from <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/">information architect</a>
