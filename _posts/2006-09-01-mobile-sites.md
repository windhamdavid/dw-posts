I am going to work on some css files so that we may take some of the sites mobile.
I think everyone will adopt a standardized format.  I can export the flash sites to different mobile configurations as is.  Some of the content from the other sites will have to be modified a bit for mobile display.  On <em>Ellen</em> the other day (that's what happens when you work from a home office without cable), Jennifer Aniston said that she loved to house hunt with something called "pocket listings". I'm sure she was talking about her cell phone or pda and not the term giving to real estate listings that go up on the MLS only after they are sold to investors.  Mobile content coming from a server.  We got to go mobile with some stuff.  I am going to configure a mobile home tour for display on newer cells and digital assistants.  They are already selling the .mobi extensions through most domain registers.
