CHALLENGE
Sell airtime on SABC channels in the lead up to the Cricket World Cup.

SOLUTION
Show media planners the shocking media options they’ll get stuck with if they don’t book with the SABC. To illustrate this we drove them to a non-existent Caribbean media company’s website to explore the dodgiest media solutions ever, reinforcing the need to book with the national broadcaster before they run out of options.

RESULTS
• exceeded sales target by 267%
• 39% more hits than targeted on launch day
• an average of 1412 hits per month
(from a maximum pool of only 750 media planners)
