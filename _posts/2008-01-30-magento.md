so i installed a couple local versions... and then <a href="http://windhamagency.net/sto">put one on a server</a> to test.  <a href="http://www.varien.com/">Varien</a> has done it right for anyone who wants all of the bells and whistles in ecommerce because they've certainly <a href="http://www.varien.com/blog/">done their research</a>.  Reports, Inventory, Paypal Api, Import/export excel spreadsheets... and a forum has been started for syncing it to quickbooks.  But I'll say this to those folks used to ZenCart or OsCommerce.. it's quite a departure and expect some more difficult hurdles to install, use, and design.  I'll let you know how it goes when i put it to the test.
