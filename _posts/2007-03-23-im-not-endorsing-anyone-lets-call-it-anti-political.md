Dear Mr. Windham ,


Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition to the new royalty rates for online radio stations proposed recently by the Copyright Royalty Board . I appreciate hearing from you.


    As you may know, the Copyright Royalty Board announced new guidelin es for I nternet radio royalties on March 5, 2007 . The guidelines set a "per play" royalty structure whereby webcasters will pay a set amount for each performance of a copyrighted song. A performance is defined as the streaming of one song t o one listener. T he guidelines also set a minimum of $500 per channel per year for both commercial and noncommercial webcasters.


    These new guidelines are a complete departure from the "percentage of revenue" structu re that is currently in effect. Like you, I have concerns about the possible negative impacts this new structure could have on consumer choice and innovation. Y ou may be pleased to know that the Copyright Royalty Board has agreed to accept requests for a new hearing until April 2, which may allow the recent guidelines to be revisited.


I greatly value your thoughts and opinions as my constituent, and I assure you that I will continue to monitor this issue. Please feel free to contact me in the future about any issue important to you or your family. It is an honor to serve you and the people of South Carolina .



Sincerely,

Jim DeMint
United States Senator
