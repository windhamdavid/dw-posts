I did this painting late last night. It's really just the underpainting, but the composition is strong.  It's of Jude Acers ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Acers">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Acers</a> ), a fellow I met in New Orleans last year. He holds two world records for simultaneous play. I like chess, although I'm only a Class C player.. yeah, it's like grades and that's just average. I don't really have enough true enthusiasm for it to get any better, although Gin has been winning against me on occasion and that helps.  The painting took me a couple hours and we listened to some good tunes on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=39">World Cafe</a> and Osei Chandler's '<a href="http://www.scetv.org/radio/programs/roots_musik_karamu/">Roots Music Karamu</a>' while Gin turned a thirty year old skirt into a new one. It's super nice out today, so I'm going '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air">en plein air</a>' this afternoon, not only because I'm digging it, but also because I'm interested in avoiding participating in the re-do of the flower beds and/or bathing the dogs.
