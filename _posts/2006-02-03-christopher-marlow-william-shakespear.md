I'm sold on this theory.  I wish I could find the documentary I saw on PBS.
I'm reminded of it every time I hear the word Shakespeare.
I never thought that the strength of the works were indicative of the author. Any great art is first and foremost authentic and William Shakespeares bio doesn't in any   way read like the author of such powerful works. Marlow's life reads like his works.
