the most interesting part of this song, besides the fact that it's the jam that enhances my dancing skills.

They are sons of a pentacostal minister who’s band is name for the intersection of (G)reenwood, (A)rcher, & (P)ine Streets. This was the location of the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Race_Riot">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Race_Riot</a>) , which was largely due to an inflammatory front-page story from the Tulsa Tribune. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Tribune">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Tribune</a>). In December 1919, Richard Lloyd Jones took ownership. On January 19, 1920, he changed the name from the Tulsa Democrat to the Tulsa Tribune. As foreshadowed by this name change, the Tribune became a consistently Republican paper; it never endorsed a Democrat for U.S. president, and did not endorse a Democrat for governor until 1958. Jones commissioned his cousin, Frank Lloyd Wright, to build him a house in Tulsa; constructed in 1929, it is known as Westhope and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Jones’s father co-founded Tulsa’s All Souls Unitarian Church, now one of the largest Unitarian Universalist churches in the world and his son, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Sr. became president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1956, and president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in 1969.

Greenwood & Archer streets are also mentioned in the western swing standard, Take Me Back to Tulsa <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Back_to_Tulsa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Back_to_Tulsa</a>. and the hit version of it, interchanged some offensive lyrics.
