Google is giving away $10,000,000 to the best applications.
The Open Handset Alliance, a group of more than 30 technology and mobile companies, is developing Android: the first complete, open, and free mobile platform.
Android is a software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications. This early look at the Android SDK provides the tools and APIs necessary to begin developing applications on the Android platform using the Java programming language. Android does not differentiate between the phone's basic and third-party applications -- even the dialer or home screen can be replaced. Android relies on Linux version 2.6 for core system services such as security, memory management, process management, network stack, and driver model. The kernel also acts as an abstraction layer between the hardware and the rest of the software stack. Android will ship with a set of core applications including an email client, SMS program, calendar, maps, browser, contacts, and others. All applications are written using the Java programming language. Xmpp, Sqlite, Freetype, OpenGl, sgl, PacketVideo's OpenCORE for media, and System C library - a BSD-derived implementation of the standard C system library (libc), tuned for embedded Linux-based devices.
