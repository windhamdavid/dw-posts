... my outlook, which my brother jinxed when he asked me why I was still using it.. died on me and of course the window's diagnostic was an office upgrade.. which let me to IE7 but I'll say this they did good with more support for css, ajax, native XMLHTTP stack, alpha transparencies in png's, the font smoothing mechanism is nice, the full screen browsing is good... the? tabs are good, the security measures are up..this looks? like a winner for everyone involved.. and I had just taken a bunch of jabs at them in my previous post.??
