Today at the 2007 National Association of Broadcasters conference (NAB2007), Microsoft and Adobe have gone tit for tat with product launches that directly target one another.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/silverlight/materials.mspx">MS press release</a>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/production/events/nab2007/webcast/">Adobe multicast</a>
and I've come to the same conclusion as <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/adobe_media_player.php">this chap</a> ...Adobe is getting into the Desktop Media Player business, which means they are competing with Microsoft's Windows Media Player directly. It is also a major opportunity for Adobe to feed the Apollo ecosystem and show people the limitations of traditional desktop software.
