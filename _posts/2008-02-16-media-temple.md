all standard pre-installed..time to migrate the dv as it's a fun saturday thing to do.... on feb 10th mt released the upgraded dedicated virtual mysql 5, php 5, centOS 5 (it's about time even though i know hosting companies that are years behind this setup).. and <a href="http://kb.mediatemple.net/article.php?id=812">migrating is cake</a> with the tools available in swsoft... but i'll have to undue the manual php upgrades and next time i'm just goin to wait for them to do it for me...<a href="http://kb.mediatemple.net/article.php?id=241">more details..</a> or try the <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/">Media Temple blog</a>....but don't get me wrong..i'm not necessarily an apple, plesk, or media temple fanboy... but i can tell you that moving away from windows and moving to media temple has been some of the smarter moves of my computing career thus far.. as windows is a joke and unix is the sh**.. and the guys at media temple (for the most part) actually know what they're doing..  if you're feeling the love or i sent you to this page to set up a hosting account... <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/go/order/?refdom=windhambrothers.com">use this link to Media Temple</a>...as i get referral credits to boot.
here's a note from the holiday season on hosting..
