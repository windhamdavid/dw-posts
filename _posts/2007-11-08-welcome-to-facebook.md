<p>Travas Hunter: I'll be arriving on Su, 11/18 and leaving on Tu, 11/20 as far as I know. I may ride with a friend and stay a bit longer... I'll know more after the meeting this afternoon. I have a few obligations upon arrival until maybe 3pm Sat. Maybe we can meet up Sat night? Send me your phone # and I'll call you when I'm in the area. Look forward to catching up!! It's been too long, Dave.</p>
