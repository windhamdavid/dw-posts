I did this painting yesterday.  I woke up early saturday morning (because we made a peach pie on friday evening and I fell asleep by eight) and I noticed the light from the sunrise was nice on my leftover veggies.  So, I worked on it off and on throughout most of the day to finish it.  I like it, although I may dabble on it a bit more.
