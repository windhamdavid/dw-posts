It always seems that when i'm working on a problem or task in computer programming that the answer usually comes to me when i'm not in front of a computer screen. I think this is because i am able to use better visual logic when i'm daydreaming in the car listening to music.  This particular case involved using <a href="http://slideshowpro.net/products/slideshowpro_director/slideshowpro_director">Slide Show Pro Director</a> to control a custom gallery and I was listening to Van Morrison's 'Live in San Fran'.  Trick was making the thumbnails customizable while using a set of custom variables and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qlia0Bq-ZmoC&pg=PA217&lpg=PA217&dq=actionscript+3.0+parallax&source=web&ots=RXd26e2z5h&sig=UTrkU4sbPBgJ3ljQdeJTAC1gWGs#PPP1,M1">actions </a>to format the thumbs as external navigation.  Press the third largest button a couple times to get them off track and then hit one of the top two buttons to line them back up.
