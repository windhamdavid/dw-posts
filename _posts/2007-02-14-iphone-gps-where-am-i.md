Ginny and i found ourselves amused with the "where the hell am i" (as we call it) on the iphone..

what a nice feature in google maps... which speaking of.. Google anounced an update to <a href="http://code.google.com/android/migrating/m3-to-m5/m5-api-changes.html">Android</a>.. fit with a <a href="http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html">media player</a> and a <a href="http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html">geocoding api</a>... mobile computing is going to be <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/11/Android-comes-to-life-in-Barcelona_1.html">big stuff</a> if you campare the number of laptop owners worldwide vs the number of cell phone users...so after tinkering around a bit.. i found a way to ssh into the phone using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/348793/jailbreak-the-iphone-113-firmware-for-third-party-apps">jailbreak</a>.. (<a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2008/01/26/warning-current-iphone-113-jailbreak-may-prevent-official-third-party-apps/">note</a>...the method may prevent installation of official third-party applications that will be created by the forthcoming iPhone SDK (software development kit) from Apple)...and now i want to install the knowitall tool of the century since this is the information age after all... wikipedia at my fingertips all the time.

and on another note...
i've recently raised my hourly fees to $40/hr as my time has become a bit more precious to me..
why is this you ask... we'll considering that i only get about five or six good hours of work in each day and the rest is consumed with email, phone calls and other stuff..

and what i've done to make it all easier on myself to keep up with invoices and payment is i am now doing all of my <a href="http://davidawindham.com/products-page/">invoicing and transactions online</a>.

and if you look.. you'll see i'm a bit on the cheap end.
