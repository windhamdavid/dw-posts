just want to give you kids a little warning out de regarding public wireless access. there is a popular little tool out now that makes it easy for pretty much any hack to steal your login for most any website. (excluding those on https://.. banks, ecommerce) so if I was you, I'd just try to avoid using any large public wireless (library, airport, starbucks) for any website that you need a password to use.
