I like this painting as is.. chunky and bold. It's of the pianist and composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>. I worked on it this afternoon while listening to his music.  And as of late, I've really been digging orchestral music. The image is from the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">US Library of Congress</a> collection.  There are some great images in those collections. The benefit to me is that it has limited copyright.  There you have it.
