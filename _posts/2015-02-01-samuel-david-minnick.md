I took my mom to lunch for her birthday this week and we got to talking family. It's pretty interesting putting the family tree together and I suppose that's why all of the geneaology websites have proliferated. Several years ago I posted a photo of the <a href="https://davidawindham.com/windhams/">Windham's Crossroads in Darlington County</a>, but I hadn't posted anything on my mom's side. I went to high school in a relatively small town and folks would come up to me and say things like we're second cousins. I didn't exactly understand it at the time, but all of the Derrick, Shealy, Metz, Koon, and Christmas('s) were generally related. I fit into that scheme via my mother's family who had been around the Dutch Fork area of South Carolina. With the big football game coming up, it reminded me of a story I'd heard about my great grandfather on my mother's side. Samuel David Minnick was born on June 1st, 1900 in Saluda County South Carolina. He graduated from Furman University in 1926 and worked as the State Officer for Standard Oil for 33 years living in and around where I live now. He pitched two winning seasons for the Furman baseball team. He also played on the football team who beat Carolina 10-0 and beat Clemson when he caught the winning touchdown on Thanksgiving Day.

They don't call it the information age for nothing. And while my folks are having fun scanning old family photos to put on Facebook, it's a bit harder to find older material unless it's been digitized by an organization. Our universities have been involved the <a href="http://scmemory.org/">South Carolina Digital Library</a> and the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a>. Furman University has been <a href="http://digicenter2.furman.edu/luna/servlet/furmanfdc~70~70">digitizing quite a bit of material</a>. So next time you go playing genealogist, remember to start top down with established orgs that are digitizing content. Here are some other photos of my great grandfather from the Furman Bonhomie 1925-1926 yearbooks.
