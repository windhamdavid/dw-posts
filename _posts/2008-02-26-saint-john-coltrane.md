i'll be... ginny got me a really cool shirt since i have expressed on a number of occasions that 'lush life' by john coltrane would be my favorite album of all time if i had one.  Anyway.. i opened the mail today and i saw.. 1286 Filmore, San Francisco as the return address.. <a href="http://www.coltranechurch.org/worship.htm">The Saint John Coltrane Church</a> is really a church.. and they have some interesting swag to boot.. they were featured in <a href="http://www.life.com/Life/churches/4.html">Time Magazine</a> as the hippest church in America.  I'll give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah">hallelujah</a> to that.
