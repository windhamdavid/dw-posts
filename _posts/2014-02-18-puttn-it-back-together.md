    I decided I’d reclaim everything I
    posted anywhere else online by getting

I decided I’d reclaim everything I posted anywhere else online by getting them back onto this site manually. Somewhere along the line I started posting more to third party sites than my own. I think I’m going to change that habit. I’ll publish it all here so I have an archive. I stopped posting to third party sites about two years ago now and I haven’t published anything here in several years either.
