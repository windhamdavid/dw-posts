this is a recent conversation with my neighbor <a href="http://davidawindham.com/my-neighbors-55lb-catfish-caught-in-the-wambaw/">dan wheeler</a>.

(me) "hey dirty, why are those chicken bones hanging on your fishing lures?" (dan) "those aren't chicken bones... they're alligator snapping turtle bones... you missed one hell of a stew"  (me)  "why are they hanging on your fishing lures?" (dan) "snapping turtle bones are what folks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howlin'_Wolf">howling wolf</a> had around his neck"
next thing i know i'm knee deep in the history of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_lure">fishing lure</a>.
