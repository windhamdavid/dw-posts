Sam Doyle: Enamel paint on metal, 28x22''

I drink starbucks, shop online, read the NYtimes.. but I don't fit the rest of the bill or call it my culture.  No matter what I can tell you of the exibits at MOMA, Apple's new OS, or of the music scene in SoCa., I think the most interesting things I can explain aren't of that ilk at all.  I am always checking the art galleries downtown Charleston with their 90% crap offerings and as the city becomes more saturated with newbies , I am reminded of how much culture is already here in the lowcountry of SC.. ie..

<em>High Sherrif of the Lowcountry</em> is a book written by <a href="http://www.lowcountrynow.com/stories/051602/LOClittlejohn.shtml">Sheriff J. E. McTeer</a>.
(1903-1979): McTeer began his 37-year term as Beaufort County Sheriff in 1926, the nation's youngest sheriff at age 22. He was a self-proclaimed witch doctor whose best-known nemesis during his law enforcement career was "root doctor" Doctor Buzzard (Stepheney Robinson), who eventually admitted that McTeer's voodoo powers were greater than his own. The Sheriff's books -- High Sheriff of the Lowcountry; 50 Years as a Lowcountry Witch Doctor; Beaufort, Now and Then; and Adventure in the Woods and Waters of the Lowcountry -- reflect the words inscribed on the bridge that now bears his name: "legendary lawman, author, spellbinder and raconteur."

The subjects of Sam Doyle's paintings are his community, the Island of St. Helena. As a child in the early 1900's, Sam Doyle saw the migration first hand. He himself was offered an opportunity, early on, to leave his island for New York City by a sister of one of his teachers at the Penn School. His refusal to migrate to New York for formal art training was a direct function of his family's impoverished condition
