<p>Be it primary, secondary, private or public, 
instead of firing teachers and furloughs, perhaps they should cut some overhead in textbooks and technology by going open source?</p>

<p>Bloated overpriced education software and IT is an understatement and the collective knowledge of years of science, math, history, language arts, and otherwise belongs to no one person, especially not that of the big education publishers and technology providers. Flat World Knowledge has a good model of licensing using Creative Commons while still taking a profit on the teacher and resource materials.</p>

<p>If this means anything to you, there is a conference you should watch this Saturday to further inform you so that you may pass that knowledge along to your schools. <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/">http://tedxnyed.com/</a></p>
