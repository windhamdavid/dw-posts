I like to watch the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/movers_shakers?lang=en">movers and shakers page on Alexa.com</a> and this is creative pop driven culture at it's best.. This guy, in trying to finance his college raises a million dollars in two months by selling ad space on one webpage??
It's up 310% to a Weekly Traffic Rank: 2,695 (was 12,730)
