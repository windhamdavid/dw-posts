“When I was Director of Central Intelligence in the 1980s, I was briefed on a plan to launch balloons into Libya dropping leaflets telling the people to overthrow the government. I told them to make sure the leaflets specifically said that it was Qaddafi who should be overthrown. I could imagine strong westerly winds carrying balloons with a generic overthrow your government right across Libya and into Egypt. I thought President Mubarak would not be pleased.”
