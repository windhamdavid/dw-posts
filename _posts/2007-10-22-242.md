wow.. the fires in so-cal look serious.. i think the times updated the number to 300,000 ...the photos said to me.. be glad i'm not evacuating my home in san diego global climate change (as karl rove has instructed i call it) is real.
for the record.. using an rss feed like this (below) will actually hurt your search engine rankings so you never duplicate any other content as a link from
your blog.  Not to mention the spam aspects of it like the yeildbuilt link below.. I never tagged that on delicious..The way to do it is make a personal note or commment on the content and only link that to the article.  I can see how the search engines are going to want to design algorithms that fight syndicated content as this is best for the end user because the search is more likely to provide source content and not syndicated content... so don't use them... plus.. who wants links anyway.. I always want to go straight to the source..
I was using this to display my del.icio.us taggd items..."rsspara:http://del.icio.us/rss/windhamdavid" and duplicate links from the sidebar is not a good idea..
