And i'm in even though adobe hasn't confirmed the compatability of CS3.. they'll make it work right after three or four weeks of updates.  Leopard... i'm looking forward to two things.. the visual improvements of core animations and spaces.  Time Machine - external disc backups.. and I can skip that day a month when i sync machines and external drives.
