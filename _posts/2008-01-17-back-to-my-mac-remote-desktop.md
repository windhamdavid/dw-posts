say goodbye to the static ip problems.. the router configuration and your possible denial of service from your ISP... I am doing a great deal of work from an office and (not wanting to give up my old days of working in my pajamas and not showering for days) i needed a way to control a network of several computers, drives and databases from other places as to free up some gasoline and driving time since i live in a very remote location... yes.. ssh, ftp, vnc, telnet etc work but you don't have a free simple gui to control applications on the other machine.. So... <a href="http://allforces.com/2007/11/06/back-to-my-mac-through-ichat/">try this from Melvin  Rivera</a>.. and now you have the best gui ever.. the other desktop be it mac or pc without the associated costs of <a href="http://www.apple.com/dotmac/backtomymac.html">.mac</a> or remote desktop from <a href="http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/">apple</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx">microsoft</a>.. and as for security.. use a dedicated google account not aim or bonjour for it since they use SSL for securing <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">google talk</a> and the file sharing is quick. Now you just have to decide when you'll need to access the computers or network and use <a href="http://www.ibeezz.com/en/">ibeez </a>to manage power modes, so i don't have to leave the computers on all night.. and Ginny will be happy to know that I can't wake them back up after 11PM
