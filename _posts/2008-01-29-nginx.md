<a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main">nginx </a> (i'm guessing it's pronounced "engine x") usage on websites worldwide <a href="http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200801/">went up 800%</a> from 07 as compared to January 08 according to netcraft.. apache still dominates in hosting, but i'm convinced that microsoft's portion will go down (even though the usage seems to still be trending up)... and lighttpd and nginx usage will increase.. as will google hosted because i must have recieved three different emails yesterday informing me as an admin as a user etc about the new google sites feature for apps.

there might be something to that..
this will get you started
curl -O http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.3.60.tar.gz
tar -xzvf nginx-0.3.60.tar.gz
cd nginx-0.3.60
./configure --sbin-path=/usr/local/sbin --with-http_ssl_module
make
sudo make install
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/nginx
That will put the executable at /usr/local/sbin/nginx
