While reading the NYtimes.com this morning, I came across this article.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/magazine/12youtube.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">"The Online Auteurs"</a>, when I came across this blog..  <a href="http://screens.blogs.nytimes.com/">"Virginia Heffernan on Web video and media convergence".</a>, where I found this interesting stat.
This video has been viewed almost 35 million times.. the most of any utube video... read the blog for a good explanation of this.
