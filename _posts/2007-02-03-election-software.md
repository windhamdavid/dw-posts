this one came from this guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Russo">Aaron Russon </a> who's endorsing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">Ron Paul </a>.. from texas in 2008... <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/">his .gov page</a>....poor Gore.. but maybe he'll get an oscar for his global warming film.. or as Karl Rove would say.. "his global climate change film"...which I might add was suprisingly good, straightfoward, and informative...
