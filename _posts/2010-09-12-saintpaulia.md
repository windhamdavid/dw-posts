This is a painting of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saintpaulia">African Violet</a> (also known as Saintpaulia) at the house.  It was raining when I started this painting and it hasn't rained since.  Besides the fact that the violets have withered and the image I have isn't very good. I'll take the good with the bad and I was expecting this painting to stump me a bit. It was a trying experience and I worked on this a couple different afternoons to no avail.  The closest I can come to really understanding why this isn't very good is that it falls somewhere in between having any expressionism and having realism.  I was too bored with it to push it any further towards realism and I wasn't able to replicate the original still life in order to capture the expression in the light.. So for the record, file under ~ trial and error. Sometimes I enjoy the failures just as much and I'll put those images up too for the record.
