many of them are great, but some are a pain in the ass.... so... my advice is as soon as you realize that one is going to be a hassle... drop em (politely) and move on, there are plenty of clients out there... go ahead and draw the 'line in the sand' so to speak.  I have only run into four of about thirty clients that were really out of line, because some people you just can't make happy, no matter how much effort you put into it.  I  spend as much time educating clients on what it is I do and other technical questions as I do building the site sometimes.
Be informed:
It's all about intellectual property and it's laws...
