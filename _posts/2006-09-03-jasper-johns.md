Jasper Johns has been breaking all kinds of auction records for a living artist.
I've only seen the works at the Metropolitain and I've kind of vaguely liked him all along, but the more I learn, the more I like him and Robert Rauschenberg.

<strong>Jasper Johns guest-starred on an episode of The Simpsons</strong> as himself. In the episode, Homer Simpson accidentally becomes an artist, and Johns attends one of his exhibitions. Johns is amusingly portrayed as a kleptomaniac, stealing items of food, lightbulbs and other small items. This was self-referential to Johns's art career, as most of his artwork came from everyday household objects.
