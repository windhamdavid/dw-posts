and why i must go this year... it's <a href="http://www.montreuxjazz.com">july 4th - 19th</a>, they won't release the schedule until mid april.. and what a way to show my patriotism by taking my american made dollars to Switzerland and spending them there...(especially since our banks and corporate boys have no problem spending abroad in much worse places)
<a href="http://www.montreuxjazz.com/news/vids_fr.aspx">this is last years line up videos</a>..notice Soloman Burke, Booker T and the MG's, Sly Stone?, Robben Ford, Van Morrison.... i had some discussion about going back to <a href="http://www.nojazzfest.com/">new orleans for jazzfest</a> but since i was just there.. i don't think it'll happen...
now.. i just need a way to pick up the extra three grand we'll need in a couple months.. I've been working on another set of music for a client and i'm back to my amature musicologist days and after our trip to new orleans, i've been digging into some new stuff again..
I have always loved cuban, brazillian, and reggae.. and this is a particularly good sound from <a href="http://www.paolonutini.com/">Paolo Nutini</a> doing a classic reggae sound with a Scottish influence? (or maybe it's my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales">Welsh decendents</a> that dictates my fondness for the sound)..

and another side note..
i have been thinking of this for some time.. we wan't to buy a houseboat (40+ footer - <a href="http://www.sharpehouseboat.com/sharpe/boats.htm">american/kentucky</a> made.. customized with computers, video, and communications equipment and cozy furnishings) and ship it to europe via oceanliner transport for canal-ing around europe.. dock it in france..pay the montly dues on it..it's going to cost a lot of money to do... and if anyone runs across this who may have the means to do this.. we figure we'll be able to rent it out for about 2-3 grand a week for most of the year (or produce a video travel log and web as well..hint hint conte nast peoples)..and what a great way to see europe without the burden of hopping around on trains to hotels which will end up sucking up most of the money.
