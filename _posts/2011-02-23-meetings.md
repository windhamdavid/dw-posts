All meetings should be on monday afternoons or tuesday mornings. Wednesday meetings seem to be an afterthought invention of middle men trying to make themselves useful. On friday morning... "how far along are we?" and I always want to say... "I'd be done by now if you hadn't waited until wednesday afternoon to bring it up"
