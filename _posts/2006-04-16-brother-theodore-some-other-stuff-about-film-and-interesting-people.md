Who Is Brother Theodore?
And how has he garnered the admiration and friendships of such people as Billy Crystal, Norman Mailer, Eric Bogasian, and Woody Allen? His television appearances have spanned from Merv Griffin to Dick Cavett to David Letterman. His diverse movie experiences have joined him with Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, and Tom Hanks. His one-man Off-Broadway show, which has drawn audiences from around the world, ran for 17 years. He is considered one of the most influential monologuist in American theater.
Who Is Brother Theodore? is an acknowledgement and preservation of the incredible journey of this most unique performer, philosopher, metaphysician.

Please note that this is taking place not in LA or NYC, but GreenVegas SC, excepting that I thought Peter Wentworth was down here on the coast near me.
Jeter had his hand in this one too...

Using "bare bones" equipment, Jason Brown and Jeter Rhodes created a unique world of 2D, computer-generated environments and effects, as well as hand made oil pastel illustrations. In 2005, Apple accepted the short for a video Podcast at the iTunes music store.

but I remember Jeter doing the videos with Sammy....
the monty pythonish spoofs.

<strong>and speaking of sammy... </strong>

<strong>Sam Beam</strong>... one of the reasons I learned to love art.
Thanks Sammy... because the last I remember it was all about joy division and new order. :)
If you hadn't been so smitten with my girlfriend in high school, I wouldn't have been jealous of your artistic talents which led me straight into art school.  I bet those folks who are fans of the music would certainly like to see some more of your artwork... and I personally would like to see the comic skits again.

and I think ya'll played Austin City Limits last night... and good work on the whole European tour delio, teaming up with Calexico, the new baby and all of your sucesses.. even the M&M commercial. Man... you even got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_&_Wine">wikipedia of yourself</a>.. strange things indeed.
