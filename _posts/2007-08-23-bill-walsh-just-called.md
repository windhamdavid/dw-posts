<a href="http://www.live5news.com/"><img src="http://www.davidwindham.org/images/wcsc.png" alt="Live 5 News Charleston" /></a><br />Shame on you <a href="http://www.live5news.com/">WCSC TV-5 in Charleston</a>... it was a taped message/poll with a 202 area code..and the funny part is the message says "this is a free poll" as if they were doing me a favor by disturbing me at home with a recorded message to try and gather content for their broadcast.  It still seems strange that the <a href="http://www.lfg.com/">Lincoln Financial Group</a> owns my local news channel, now that's advertising power.
