someone asked me recently about investing in artwork..
i said "investing? what... just buy what you like and sell what you thought you liked"

Dali established three major artistic themes, which would form the core of his work for the rest of his career:  enigmas, Gala, and melted clocks. The images were produced using what he called the "paranoiac critical" method, which Dali explained as a "spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on critical and systematic objectivation of delirious associations and interpretations."
The paranoiac-critical method was simple. The artist tricks himself into going insane, while somewhere deep within remembering that the reason for the insanity is to create a great work of art. Dali chose to do it the hard way -- by actually going mad, rather than simulating madness through chemical means. "I don't take drugs. I am drugs," he once explained.
A theologian could have a field day wondering about God's paranoiac-critical approach to creating the world. The psychiatrist may wonder what might be the difference between pretending to be completely insane while secretly knowing you aren't, and actually being completely insane and secretly holding the delusional belief that you aren't. (Dali himself once explained this by writing, "There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.")
The cultural observer simply contents himself with noting that this "method" provided Dali with a good excuse to do whatever he felt like, all in the name of art.
