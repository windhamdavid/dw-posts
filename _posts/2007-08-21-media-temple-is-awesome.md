I've had hosting at four other companies.. (<a href="http://www.vpsland.com">vpsland</a>, <a href="http://www.spry.com">spry</a>, dreamhost, godaddy) and I've had dealings with many of the others... this morning they had some network problems on some of their dv's.. one phone call.. they immediately post on their weblog and fix within minutes... this is a cue for them to pick up on my shameless promotion and discount my $120 month plan to $60 because we keep two grid servers and two dv's with them. :)
